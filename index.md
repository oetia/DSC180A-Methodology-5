## Prompt Answers

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

LLM Reasoning in the context of web agents. This is probably one of the most practical applications of large language models. Usually for web automation, it takes a great deal of effort to create a customized script for one specific webpage, and upon navigating elsewhere, said script rarely generalizes over. The "common sense" that LLMs seem to exhibit (to some degree) are promising for being able to complete a broad range of tasks in arbitrary web environments. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**

The professor already has an LLM Reasoner's library that his lab has developed. Our quarter 1 progress has already been heavily involved with this library. To be able to add support for agent environments for this library, would be extremely useful, especially when considering the wide support already available for various search algorithms. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

The professor is busy, and is taking a more hands-off approach, which is perfectly understandable. We're pretty much just interacting with some of his PHD students every once in a while, which isn't a bad thing, but we more often than not have to be extremely independent. It isn't necessarily a bad thing, but at the same time, neither is it particularly great. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Throughout this quarter, my entire capstone group has been pretty interested in reproducing gpt4-o1 on a smaller scale. There's quite a lot that is unknown about exactly what is going on, but we've been talking about a lot of ideas involving self-improvement through generating high quality chains from MCTS guided tree search on the tree of thought. Would be cool to find a way to explore this further, as it has been for the most part been benched.
